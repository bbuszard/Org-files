	The workout went fairly well. 215 for press singles weren't a 
        problem. My shoulders feel fine, but my left elbow is pretty
        sore. I don't know if there's anything short of extensive rest
        that will make it settle down, nor do I know what the primary
        cause of the problem might be.

	I was supposed to do the press workout last night, but ended up helping
	Jon with ham radio concepts instead.

	Skvats went pretty well. I had doubles and only the last
	set was really grindy. DB rows with 60 lbs. are getting
	heavy, and curls with 15 lbs. were QUITE hard.

	Moved skvat workout from yesterday to today. The plan
	now is to workoug Fri-Sun-Tues-Thurs-Sat.
