	The workout went fairly well. 215 for press singles weren't a 
        problem. My shoulders feel fine, but my left elbow is pretty
        sore. I don't know if there's anything short of extensive rest
        that will make it settle down, nor do I know what the primary
        cause of the problem might be.

	I was supposed to do the press workout last night, but ended up helping
	Jon with ham radio concepts instead.
